# Commands
## Spawns
- .spawn <pokemon> <lat,lon> <optional_description>
- .spawn sandshrew 34.123456,-118.123456
- .spawn sandshrew 34.123456,-118.123456 100IV L30
- Please keep in mind, there are to be NO spaces in between the lat,lon
## Quests
- Please keep in mind, each argument is supposed to be in between it's own quotes, in the correct order!
- .quest <pokestop> <quest> <quest_reward>
- .quest "undersea fish mural" "catch 5 fire types" "3 hyper potions"
- The bot will find closely matching names as well, so no need to type them out completey (for pokestop name)
- Example: if "That One Red Lion" was a pokestop name, you can do:
. .quest "red lion" "catch 3 water types" "5 pokeballs"
## Admin Tools
- The following are limited to admins only, as chosen by the bot owner
- **.resetquests** _or_ **.rq** to clear the quests channel at midnight/quests change.
- **.setprefix** to set the prefix, by default the prefix is **.**

#Setup
- Coming soon. Easy to figure out, otherwise.
